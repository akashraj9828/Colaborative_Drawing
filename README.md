## App Info

 This project was initially aimed to make a game similar to agar.io but it ended up being a colaborative drawing application when multiple users can come together and draw something on a shared canvas. You can use it to play tic-tac-toe or drawing guessing games with friends but the possibilities are endless.

 The app is deployed [here](https://col-draw.herokuapp.com/)

 Feel free to copy the code, modify it and add more cool features to it. If you'll give me proper credit that would make me very happy :')
